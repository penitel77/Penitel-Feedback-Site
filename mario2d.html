<h2>üéÆ Project Summary: Building a 2D Mario-Style Platformer in Unity</h2>
<img src="MyImages/Screenshot 2025-06-04 074243.png" alt="Mario Game" class="preview-img" />

<p>I began this project with the goal of building a 2D Mario-style platformer game in Unity, completely from scratch. I wanted the process to be broken down into small, manageable tasks, so I followed a step-by-step approach to help myself learn Unity while building the actual game.</p>
<h2>üß± Project Setup and Environment</h2>
<p>I started by making sure Unity was properly installed and set up a new 2D project using the 2D Built-In Render Pipeline, which I chose over the 2D Universal Render Pipeline to keep things simple and avoid the complexities of URP.

After creating the new project and opening it, I wasn't sure what to do next, so I took screenshots and sought out precise guidance on the first steps.</p>

<h2>üßç Creating the Player</h2>
<p>I created a basic player GameObject using a simple Cube as a placeholder character. At first, I wasn‚Äôt sure which shape to use, but I decided a cube was fine since I‚Äôd be replacing it later with a sprite. I added a Rigidbody2D to handle physics and a BoxCollider2D for collisions.

Initially, the player didn‚Äôt fall or interact with the ground. I realized that the ground also needed a collider, so I added a BoxCollider2D to it and made sure the player‚Äôs Rigidbody2D had gravity enabled.</p>

<h2>üé• Adjusting the Camera</h2>
<p>At this point, I noticed the camera wasn‚Äôt following the player, and sometimes the character moved off-screen. I adjusted the camera manually to center it on the player for now. I plan to use Unity‚Äôs Cinemachine later for a smoother follow system, but this worked for the initial stages.

  <h2>üë§ Replacing the Cube with a Sprite Character</h2>

<P>Next, I imported a .png image of my character and added it as a new GameObject with a Sprite Renderer. I made sure the texture type was set to Sprite (2D and UI). After that, I deleted the old cube so that only the new sprite character remained.

I briefly wondered if I needed to slice the sprite, but since it wasn‚Äôt a spritesheet (just a single full-body sprite), no slicing was necessary.</P>

<P>Also i noticed the Animator folder was empty, and Unity gave me an error about a missing Animator component. That happened because one of my scripts was referencing animation parameters. Since I wasn‚Äôt ready to set up animations yet, I decided to continue without the Animator and focus on gameplay mechanics first.

</P>

<p>By the time I took my third screenshot, I had the custom sprite character successfully in the game, visible on screen. I had configured gravity and colliders, and the player was interacting correctly with the ground. The basic platformer setup was complete, and I was ready to move on to mechanics like movement, coins, obstacles, and enemies.</p>
